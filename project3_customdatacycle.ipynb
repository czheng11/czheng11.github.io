We can see that both tables have one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle and contains details on the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle. Furthermore, we can go another layer and see that vevent_2016 has redundant data with cevent_2016 as vevent_2016 has the same data elements but also record the VIN as an identifier for data. \n",

Therefore, this data could be redundant multiple times. \n",

There is also a many to one relationship between person_2016 records and both vehicle_2016 records and accident_2016. violatn_2016 has at least one record per vehicle so it has a many to one relationship with vehicle_2016 records. \n"

        "\n",
        "There is a column called consecutive_number is a unique case number assigned to each crash. This data element is used to join all the data files together. In a sense, consecutive_number acts like a foreign key to allow us to join tables. In this sense we can see that the data we are looking at could be displayed in one large table, but this would not be ideal. The authors instead decided to split the dataset into tables for specific discrete pieces of information. In this sense the tables are normalized into tables that often have one to many/many to one relationships in order to better model a crash. This is important because a crash can for example have any number of in-transit vehicles. If this data was modeled as columns we would need either one column for each car which would be infeasible to account for n cars where n is sufficiently large. Moreover, even if we ensure that we have a column for max n cars the majority of the records in the columns will be null. Yes there are keys in the functional dependency sense. For example, in the accident_2016 table we can clearly see that the key is consecutive_number. And, for vehicle_2016, violatn_2016 and person_2016 there are also keys.  Within the four tables that we choose to dive deeper into we do not see an OKV style breakdown of data. For example, within the accident_2016 table we have columns like number_of_vehicle_forms_submitted_all, number_of_parked_working_vehicles, number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit, etc. which would probably be more efficiently stores in the OKV sense. This way it would also be easier to tag on another piece of data that for example looks at number_of_[NEW DATA]. This is a tradeoff that we believe the author of the dataset should have made to better optimize their data."

        "This is interesting. We can see that if there is one drunk driver involved in an accident the average number of fatalities increases by around 0.03 which is trivial. However, if there are two drunk drivers in an accident than the number of fatalities increased by 0.23! We see that for 3 drunk drivers involved, there's a significant increase in average number of fatalities per crash but since there may be a small number of crashes of this type in the dataset, we may not be able to infer too much. From these findings, we think that the presence of drunk drivers in a crash may be a small predictor of additional fatalities (>1)."

        "In this part we will create a BigQuery ML model that will predict in a crash that has 2 or more people if there will be more than 1 fatality. We decided to work on this specific model because the dataset we choose only contains accidents in which there is at least 1 fatality. In order to do this prediction we first exclude all accidents in which there were only one person invlolved. Next we create a label that is 1 if more than 1 person is fataly injured and 0 if only 1 person is fatally injured. Specifically, we are training a binary logistic regression model that predicts if there are more than 1 person fatally injured.\n",

We printed the data and observed that although our data was 60/40 split 1s and 0s, for some reason the evaluation set is all 0. Also, the math doesn’t work out for why we are getting an accuracy of ~0.77 given the above observations. We went to office hours to try to resolve the issue and find the root causes, but was unable to figure out why the math is so wrong. The TA said it’s probably a bug in the system and we should move on. We tested a few threshold values for the binary logistic regression and found a local (maybe global) optimum at the threshold 0.23. We decided to evaluate and predict with this threshold. \n"

        "\n",
        "What have you learned? What conclusions have you made or been unable to make about your dataset and why? What is obvious, and what did you not expect to see? Support your statements with the charts or predictions you generated. If you had more time, what other data exploration would you pursue? \n",
        "\n",
        "In this project we explored the bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities dataset specifically looking at the relationship between certain features and fatalities. \n",
        "\n",
        "Right off the bat we did a simple query to count the number of fatalities per state, we saw that California and Texas had the most fatalities (Fig. 1). However, we realized that this may be due to the fact that California and Texas both have very high populations. In order to remedy this, we then normalized the number of fatalities by the population in each state in the next query. In this query we can see that now California and Texas on average do not have the highest number of fatalities! Instead, states like South Carolina and Alabama had higher rates(Fig. 2). We did a similar process for number of drunk drivers and saw similar trends, such as northeast having low numbers of drunk drivers and number of fatalities, while midwest seems higher (Fig. 3 & 4). However, the maps did not exactly match so number of drunk drivers does not guarantee similarly colored average number of fatalities. From this, we found that the state in which the crash occurred would be a good predictor for testing whether there are more than one fatality. \n",
        "\n",
        "Next, since we were interested in seeing what factors would influence the likeliness of crashes occurring with more than one fatality, we decided to see which factors influenced average number of fatalities, since higher average fatalities would imply increased number of crashes with more than 1 fatality. Starting with the number of drunk drivers, we found that increased number of drunk drivers showed a trend of increasing the average number of fatalities (Fig. 5). This was in line with what we hypothesized initially because drunk drivers may engage in riskier behavior, leading to increased average number of fatalities per crash, so the result is not very surprising. Next, we investigated the effect of day of the week of crash (Fig. 6). We found that weekends generally had a higher average number of fatalities. Interestingly, the shape of the graph also closely matched the one when we graphed average number of drunk as a function of day of the week of crash. This indicated that the day of the week when the crash occurs could be a good predictor for whether a crash occurs with more than 1 fatality. As you can see in Fig. 7, we then investigated hour of day and noticed…. In relation to the graph on number of drunk drivers. \n",
        "\n",
        "We then investigated if body type was a influencing factor on average number of fatalities and found that if a bus body_type was involved, the average number of fatalities was significantly greater than other body types (Fig. 8). This makes sense since buses generally have larger amounts of passengers than other vehicle types. Interestingly, the car body type with the highest average number of fatalities is 3-door/2-door hatchbacks. Interestingly, convertibles have lower average number of fatalities than 2-door hatchbacks, 2-door coupes and 4-door sedans. This is very interesting because society usually perceives convertibles as more dangerous since they do not have a hardtop. Perhaps there were not enough samples since there’s only 341 convertible crash incidents compared to 13216 samples for 4-door sedans.\n",
        "\n",
        "We looked into whether the age of the driver influenced the average number of fatalities (Fig. 9). There was no noticeable trend for younger or older ages leading to increased average number of fatalities. However, in the case of a 12-year old driver, there’s a significant increase in average number of fatalities. This may also be due to a low sample size of crashes involving a 12-year old driver. Thus, we determined age would not be a good predictor for crash fatalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we wanted to get a better sense of the data prior to building our machine learning model (Fig. 10). We graphed the distributions for number of accidents per number of fatalities. We noticed that most accidents only involved 1 fatality. However, from looking at injury severity, we see that there are a large number of people involved in crashes that are not fatally injured (do not become a fatality). Then we looked at the number of people involved in accidents, we saw that the majority of accidents involved only 1 person. However, 13808 accidents involved more than 1 person, which is enough samples to work with since we decided to investigate, excluding the instances where there’s only one person involved in the crash (guaranteed fatality), whether or not there’s another person involved in the crash that is a fatality?\n",
        "\n",
        "If we had more time we would have loved to have a dataset of accidents in where there were no fatalities. We were limited by this dataset because each accident had at least 1 fatality. If we had access to data of all accidents we could better analyze the specific features that directly affect the probability of an occupant in a car being fatally injured. Another piece of data that would have been extremely helpful is the total number of trips per car/body type. This data would allow us to normalize accidents for each body type of vehicle to get a better sense of the probability of getting into a fatal accident in the vehicle. \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, we would have loved to explore data over multiple years. Crash data for just the United States for just one year is not enough data to train a sophisticated prediction model. If we had more time and more data we would have loved to train a simple multilayer neural network that has more predictive power than a binary logistical regression model."
